# one-voice
As more and more devices allow for voice commands, it will become increasingly difficult to keep up with the syntax of the commands.

As an example:
One device may allow for "ok [device], play [song] by [artist]"
While another device may allow for "[device], jam out to [song] by [artist]"

This codebase (coupled with an input/output device) will handle the translation for you.

Devices: Smart TV's, PS4, GoPro, Alexa, OK Google, etc.
